<h1>EVERY MEMBER HAS TO OPEN A NEW BRANCH!</h1>
<BR>
<h2>EVERY BRANCH HAS TO BE PUSHED FROM YOUR LOCAL REPO TO THE REMOTE REPO</h2>
<h3>REMEBER TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE DESCRIPTION FOR YOUR GOALS WHEN CREATING THE BRANCH IN THE FIRST COMMIT</h3>
TO BUILD THE CONTAINERS NETWORK : 
<br>
1 - AFTER CLONNING THE GIT DIRECTORY, TRAVERSE TO THE DOCKER-COMPOSE.YML FILE DIRECTORY
<br>
2 - OPEN A NEW TERMINAL AND RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMAND : 
<br>
    "docker-compose up -d" (IF USING V2 U CAN TYPE docker compose instead of docker_compose if it triggered an error)
<br>
3 - FOR TERMINATION, USE : 
<br>
    "docker-compose stop" 
<br>
<h2>IN CASE OF ANY CHANGES TO THE BUILD FILES, NOTIFY ME</h2>
<br>
<h2>REMEMBER TO ALWAYS PULL THE NEW CHANGES FROM THE MAIN BRANCH TO ENSURE HAVING THE BASIC BUILDS</h2>
